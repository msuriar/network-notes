BGP CAPABILITIES ADVERTISEMENT [RFC 5492]

BGP peers may use the optional parameter 'Capabilities' within the BGP OPEN message to advertise certain capabilities to neighbours. (e.g. route refresh, multi-protocol support)

The capabilities parameter (parameter type 2) consists of one or more TLV triples:

    0               7                15
    +----------------+----------------+--------------------------------+
    |Capability code |Capability len  | Capability value (variable len)|
    +----------------+----------------+--------------------------------+

Capability code: 1 octet unsigned integer, uniquely identifying each capability.

Capability length: 1 octet, contains the length of the VALUE field, in octets.

When a BGP speaker that supports capability advertisement sends an OPEN to a peer; the 'Capability parameter' MAY be included. A speaker that supports a specific capability may use that capability with a peer once it is determined that the peer supports this capability. (Through the presence of this capability in the 'Capability' optional parameter of the OPEN received from the neighbour.)

If the neighbour responds with a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Subcode set to 'Unsupported optional parameter', the originating speaker SHOULD attempt to reestablish the peering, this time omitting the capabilities optional parameter.

If a BGP speaker that supports a given capability determines that a peer does not support this capability, the speaker MAY send a NOTIFICATION and terminate the peering. The Error Subcode of the NOTIFICATION should be set to 'Unsupported Capability'; the data field SHOULD contain the list of capabilities that caused the error. If a NOTIFICATION is received with an Error Subcode of 'unsupported capability', the peering in question SHOULD NOT be automatically reestablished.


ROUTE REFERESH CAPABILITY [RFC 2918]

Prior to the invention of route-refresh, the only means of re-applying inbound routing policy were:

1) A shutdown and re-establishment of the BGP neighbour relationship.
2) 'soft-reconfiguration'; maintaining a copy of all routes sent by a peer, including those dropped by inbound policy.

Both of these options have limitations, either in terms of possible reconvergence or increased memory/CPU overhead on BGP speakers.

Route refresh provides the abiilty for a BGP speaker to dynamically re-request all prefixes from its neighbour.

The route refresh capability is advertised using a capability code of 2, and a capability length of 0.

Route refresh makes use of a new BGP message type, ROUTE-REFRESH (message type 5).

    0                               15               23               31
    +--------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
    |    Address Family Identifier   |  Reserved      |    SAFI        |
    +--------------------------------+----------------+----------------+

Address family identifier: 16-bit, see [RFC 4760]
Reserved: should be set to all zeroes by transmitter, ignored by receiver.
Subsequent address family identifier: 8-bit, see [RFC 4760]

Once a BGP speaker has determined that a neighbour supports the route refresh capability, it may at any time send a route-refresh message for any <AFI,SAFI> that was advertised during the OPEN procedure. This should result in the peer retransmitting all of its routing information.
