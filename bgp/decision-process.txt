BGP DECISION PROCESS

Feasible: recursed next hop is reachable in the IGP routing table.
Weight: locally defined, Cisco proprietary attribute. Higher weight is more preferred.
Local-Pref: set within an AS to control which  exit point for a prefix is more preferred. Higher LP is preferred.
Locally originated: prefer path which was locally (i.e. on this device) originated via a network statement, aggregate address statement, or redistribution from another protocol.
AS-path length: lowest AS-path length wins.
Origin: IGP is more preferred than EGP, which is more preferred than INCOMPLETE
MED: Used as a tiebreak between two different paths to the same AS; lowest MED is more preferred.Path type: EBGP most preferred, IBGP
IGP cost to next hop: lowest cost wins.
Multiple EBGP paths: prefer oldest path. (i.e. one that was installed in the RIB first.)
BGP RID: prefer route from speaker with the numerically lowest RID.
Cluster list length: If originator/RID is the same for multiple paths, use the path with the shortest 'cluster list' attribute. (RR only)
Neighbour address: prefer the path from the lowest neighbour address (peer address, rather than RID).
