OSPF PROTOCOL OVERVIEW [RFC 2328, RFC 1587]

OSPF is a link-state routing protocol; an open standard based on Djikstra's algorithm. It uses reliable flooding to ensure information about network topology is flooded throughout an autonomous system.

OSPF uses a single, dimensionless metric. Each interface in OSPF has a cost associated with it. The default cost as calculated by Cisco is 10^8/bandwidth. OSPF cost is an integer, so all interfaces with a speed of 100Mbps or more end up with an OSPF cost of 1.

Areas are used to provide stability and scalability, but abstracting the topology of an area away from those routers outside that area.

OSPF consists of four main components.

Hello protocol: this is used for neighbour discovery, as well as dead neighbour detection.

Adjacencies: if the parameters specified in the Hello protocol are configured correctly across both neighbours, and some other conditions are met (particularly in NBMA/broadcast networks), the neighbors will become ADJACENT. LSAs are only flooded to adjacent neighbors.

Database: the link-state database for an OSPF area is the sum of all router link states from within that area.

Flooding: LSAs (link-state advertisements) are flooded throughout an area, and summarised by area border routers.
