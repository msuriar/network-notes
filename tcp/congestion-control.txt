TCP CONGESTION CONTROL [RFC 2581]

TCP congestion control details several mechanisms through which TCP detects and responds to congestion in the network.

DEFINITIONS:
SMSS: Sender maximum segment size. (576 octets, if TCP MSS option is not used)
RMSS: Receiver maximum segment size. (576 octets, if TCP MSS option is not used)
RWND: Most recently advertised receiver window.
CWND: Congestion window; TCP state variable. A sender MUST NOT send data with SEQ > (ACK + min {RWND, CWND}).
IW: Initial window size. Size of congestion window after 3-way handshake.
LW: Loss window size. Size of congestion window after a sender detects loss due to retransmission timer.
RW: Restart window size. Size of congestion window after idle peiod. (See TCP slow start).
FLIGHT SIZE: The amount of data sent but not ACKed.
SSTHRESH: slow start threshold; determines whether 'slow start' or 'congestion avoidance' is used.

SLOW START/CONGESTION AVOIDANCE

IW MUST be <= 2 * SMSS. (Initially, no more than 2 MSS worth of data may be in flight.)

		if (CWND < SSTHRESH) then 'slow-start' in use
		else if (CWND > SSTHRESH) then 'congestion avoidance' in use
		else use either

During 'slow start', CWND is incremented by 1 RMSS for every ACK received which is ACKing new data.

During congestion avoidance, CWND is incremented by 1 RMSS every RTT.

Whenever a sender's retransmission timer is triggered, SSTHRESH must be adjusted.

		SSTHRESH = max(FLIGHT SIZE /{2, 2*SMSS})

On  a timeout, CWND must be set to LW =  1*RMSS. After retransmission, SS kicked in until CWND reaches the new SSTHRESH.


FAST RETRANSMIT/FAST RECOVERY [RFC 2581]

A receiver SHOULD send an immediate DUPACK on recipt of an out-of-order segment. This can be caused by loss or reordering. When an incoming segment fills a gap, an immediate ACK should also be sent.

A sender SHOULD use "fast retransmit" to repair loss. 3 DUPACKs (4 ACKs for the same SEQ) should trigger an immediate retransmission, without waiting for retransmission timer expiration of next SEQ.

Detail:
1) After 3rd DUPACK, SSTHRESH = max(FLIGHT SIZE /{2, 2*SMSS}). (3rd DUPACK is equivalent to detection of loss.)
2) Retransmit, then set CWND = SSTHRESH + 3*SMSS. (3 DUPACKs => 3 segments received after the lost segment.)
3) For each subsequent DUPACK, increment CWND by SMSS.
4) Transmit next segment, if permitted by RWND and CWND.
5) Once new data is ACKed, set SSTHRESH as (1).

SLOW START AFTER IDLE
In some implementations, if a segment has not been received within one retransmission timeout, CWND is reduced to RW.

DELAYED ACK [RFC 2581, RFC 1122]
An ACK SHOULD be generated for every 2 MSS of data received. An ACK MUST be generated within 500ms of receipt of the data to be ACKed.

NAGLE'S ALGORITHM
If a receiver receives < 1 MSS of data, *while* there is un-ACKed data in flight, wait until the receiver has more data to send or the ACK comes back, before sending his own ACK.
