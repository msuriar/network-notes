TCP WINOW SCALING [RFC 1323]

By default, TCP only supports a window of 65,536 bytes (64Kbytes). This means that a receiver may only transmit 64KBytes of data before waiting for an acknowledgement. On high latency and/or high bandwidth links, this can lead to a significant reduction in the effective throughput for a single TCP connection.

The effective throughput of a TCP connection is limited to:

    Window size/latency

Without window scaling enabled, TCP defaults to a window size of:
    65,536 bytes = 524,288 bits.

Assuming a latency of 100ms, and the above window size, te maximum achievable bandwidth for a single TCP connection can be calculated.

100ms = 0.1s

Throughput (bits/sec) = window size (bits)/latency (sec)
                      = 524,288/0.1
                      = 5,242,880 bps
                      = 655,360 Bps
                      = 655.36 KBps

The TCP window scaling option allows TCP participants to scale their receive windows, eliminating this bottleneck.
